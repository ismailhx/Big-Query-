To make better sense of these queries please read the schema for the datasets on BigQuery.

Query 1: 
Selects this: `bigquery-public-data.usa_names.usa_1910_current` dataset

SELECT*  FROM `bigquery-public-data.usa_names.usa_1910_current` LIMIT 1000



Query 2: 
Finding out for each state - how many people born in 2001 in the USA are named Ismail

SELECT
state,name,gender,year,number

  FROM `bigquery-public-data.usa_names.usa_1910_2013` 
  where name = "Ismail" and year = 2001
  LIMIT 100



Query 3:
weather.stn AS stn_ID -

Selects the stn attribute as stn_ID from the 'bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.gsod2015' table.



ANY_VALUE(station.name) AS name -

ANY_VALUE The any_value function returns any random value of the selected column. (solves error 1055) 

(station.name) Return any value from the stations table’s column ‘name’  (there can be multiple stations with the same id - pick any random one)

AS name - Rename the column ‘name’



INNER JOIN – joins the tables on usaf and stn this finds all the stations run by the us airforce


WHERE
  station.state = "WA" AND station.usaf != "999999"
  GROUP BY stn_id
  
 - This filters the query to show only states in washington where the usaf number isnt 999999 and groups the queries by station id
 
  
  
  

SELECT
  weather.stn AS stn_ID, ANY_VALUE(station.name) AS name
  FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.stations` AS station
  INNER JOIN `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.gsod2015` AS weather
  ON station.usaf = weather.stn
WHERE
  station.state = "WA" AND station.usaf != "999999"
  GROUP BY stn_id
LIMIT
  1000
